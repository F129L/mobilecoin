# Environment Variables: How to Configure Your Node

The following environment variables should be provided:

| Variable                     | Value          | Function                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `LOCAL_NODE_ID`              | address:port   | Local node name for logging. Should ideally match the value of `peer-responder-id` as provided to consensus-service.                                                                                                                                                          |
| `NODE_LEDGER_DIR`            | Path to ledger | The location of the ledger. We suggest that this should be persistently stored outside the container and mounted in. On startup, if the contents of `NODE_LEDGER_DIR` are empty, then the origin block from within the container should be copied into the `NODE_LEDGER_DIR`. |
| `CONSENSUS_ADMIN_URI`        | URI            | The URI for the admin http service which provides a management panel to the consensus service. The gateway is started in the container and is set to listen via this environment variable. Used by mc-admin-http-gateway.                                                     |
| **AWS\_ACCESS\_KEY\_ID**     | AWS Credential | Should have write access to your S3 ledger archive bucket. Used by ledger-distribution.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **AWS\_SECRET\_ACCESS\_KEY** | AWS Credential | Should have write access to your S3 ledger archive bucket. Used by ledger-distribution.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|                              |                |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
